# Shovel-Knight

A side-scrolling platformer created in Java using the LibGDX graphics framework and Object Oriented Programming. Tne user controls a character who can
jump and swing his sword, and they must make their way through levels by avoiding holes in the ground while simultaneously eliminating enemies. Enemies
drop random amounts of gems that can be collected by the player. Players can also collect power ups in order to make their experience easier, such as
heightened damage, player speed, etc. This game was created as a final project for the ICS4U course that I took in high school.
